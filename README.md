# YouTube Speed

A simple chrome extension to control YouTube playback rate with keybinds


## TODO:

- [X] Set custom default rate for specific channels
- [X] UX friendly way to show the current playback rate
- [X] Search bar
- [X] Show the correct playback speed in the Google Settings pane ui
- [X] Set default rate for all videos
- [X] Auto-skip commercials when available
- [X] When switching videos within the same tab, adjust speed to the current channel
- [X] Speed up non-skippable ads
- [ ] Sorting based on clicking the column header

## Bugs:

- [X] After an ad playback resets to original
- [X] When a video starts with an ad - skip it too
- [X] When the video is opened in a new tab, youtube speed doesnt load the content script (requires refresh)
- [X] Maintain playback ratio when leaving and returning to tab
- [ ] Playlist next video doesnt adjust playback rate
- [ ] Navigating to YouTube page from history (Cmd+Shift+T) doesn't change playback rate
- [ ] Set rate limit under default doesn't apply
